## 🪐 Hydrogen Atom in a Circularly Polarized Microwave Field

This project was carried out as part of the course **Qualitative and Quantitative Methods for Dynamical Systems**.  
The objective was to explore and understand the complex dynamics of a hydrogen atom driven by a circularly polarized microwave field, following and expanding upon the reference paper:

> **E. Barrabés, M. Ollé, F. Borondo, D. Farrelly, J.M. Mondelo**  
> *Phase space structure of the hydrogen atom in a circularly polarized microwave field*  
> Phys. Rev. A 86, 063428 (2012)

Starting from this work, I implemented the proposed numerical strategies **from scratch in MATLAB** and suggested complementary approaches to deepen the analysis of this nonlinear dynamical system.

The study includes:

- Construction of the effective Hamiltonian  
- Analysis of Hill's regions and energetically allowed domains  
- Location and classification of fixed points  
- Exploration of stable/unstable manifolds and transition mechanisms  
- Poincaré sections and the onset of chaotic behavior  
- Transport through bottlenecks and escape to ionization  

🧠 The goal was not only to replicate known results but to develop a self-contained codebase and gain new insight into the system's phase space structure.
